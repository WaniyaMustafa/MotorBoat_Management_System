# MotorBoat_Management_System  
**Read Me**  
Create a new NetBeans project, called MotorBoatManagementSystem
For this task you are required to write a Java 8 program that incorporates a series of Java classes that represent the core logic of an application and provides a NetBeans 8 console user interface. The required Java application relates to a proposed software system to manage some aspects of a motorboat club, including hiring motorboats and training session bookings (lessons) for any given week. Below is an initial description of the system domain.   
**System domain**  
There are two types of members: novices and motorboat licence holders (MBLH). The club employs several instructors (who are not members), and each novice is assigned to a single instructor. All members and instructors are identified by their name. An instructor can provide individual lessons to either their assigned novices or to MBLHs (who are not assigned to instructors). The club owns 10 motorboats, and each has a unique name to identify it. Lessons, which are one hour long and start on the hour (between the hours of 09:00 and 18:00), can be booked for all seven days of the week. Lessons are each taken by a single member and provided by one instructor in one of the club motorboats. MBLHs may book motorboats for hire by the day (i.e., from 09:00 to 18:00) for one hour (on the hour) without involving an instructor. A member may be scheduled to take no more than three lessons for any given week. A MBLH may have bookings for no more than two motorboat hires per week. Motorboats, instructors, and members can each be involved in only one lesson or hire at any one time.   
Your task is to design a Java 8 program for the motorboat management system described above, which provides a console-based (text I/O) user interface that facilitates the five use cases listed in Appendix B. An initial analysis of the domain has already been completed, and a class model has been designed as shown in Figure:

Figure: Class model of the motorboat domain.    
The class diagram above is provided as a design for your Java implementation, i.e., your application must include Java classes for the above class model as a minimum. You can extend/enhance the model if you wish to, but the above model structure must be implemented as specified. You are not required to submit any UML for this task.  
Your program must provide a console-based User interface menu, with a selectable menu item for each of the five use cases. Your application should pre- load some ‘dummy’ data into the application, but also allow information to be input (use cases 1 and 4) during runtime. Pre-loaded data should be achieved by coding data directly within the Java program. It should not use an external database link (e.g., such as an SQL database). All pre-loaded data should be readonly. Any data that is input during the runtime of the Java program should be volatile i.e., it should exist only for the time the program is executing and should not be stored to non-volatile location such as an external file or a database.   
**Use case #1: Book lesson for member**   
1 - The software system prompts the User (i.e., the administrator) to select a member from a list of members. If the selected member has already reached their limit on lessons for the week, then the system informs the User (by displaying an appropriate message) and takes no further action (i.e., the system returns to the main menu).  
2a - If the selected member is a novice, then the system displays the instructor’s name that the novice is allocated to and displays a weekly schedule of lessons for that instructor (i.e., for the current week), indicating which hourly slots are currently free for that instructor (and conversely, which slots are already booked).   
2b - If the selected member is a MBHL, then the system prompts the User to select an instructor from a list of instructor names displayed to the console. On selection of an instructor, the system displays a weekly schedule of lessons for that instructor (i.e., for the current week), indicating which hourly slots are currently free for that instructor (and conversely, which slots are already booked).   
3 - The User is then prompted to enter a day and time (from the displayed schedule) to propose a booking.   
4a - If the member or the instructor is already involved with a lesson at the day/time of the proposed booking (i.e., User selection), or the member is a MBLH and has a motorboat hire at the day/time of the proposed booking, then the system informs the User (by displaying an appropriate message) and takes no further action (i.e., the system returns to the main menu).   
4b - Otherwise, the system checks whether any of the club motorboats are available at the selected time/day (i.e., they are not already booked for either a lesson or a hire at the selected time/day).  
4b(i) - If there are no available club motorboats available at that time/day, the system informs the user (by displaying an appropriate message) and takes no further action (i.e., the system returns to the main menu)   
4b(ii) - If any of the club motorboats are available, then the names of the available motorboats are displayed to the console and the User is prompted to select which motorboat should be used and, on selection, the lesson is recorded (for the runtime of the program). A confirmation message is displayed with the details of the lesson.  
**Use case #2: List member lessons**   
1 - The system allows the User (i.e., the administrator) to select a member from a list of members of the motorboat club. 
2a - If the member currently has no lesson bookings for that week, then the system informs the user (by displaying an appropriate message) and takes no further action (i.e., the system returns to the main menu)   
2b - If the member does have lesson bookings, then the system displays the details (instructor, day, time, and motorboat name) of the bookings ordered by day and then time.  
**Use case #3: List instructor lessons**  
1 - The system allows the User (i.e., the administrator) to select an instructor from a list of instructors of the motorboat club.  
2a - If the instructor currently has no lesson bookings for that week, then the system informs the user (by displaying an appropriate message) and takes no further action (i.e., the system returns to the main menu)   
2b - If the instructor does have lesson bookings, then the system displays the details (member, day, time, and motorboat name) of the bookings ordered by day and then time.   
**Use case #4: Hire motorboat for MBLH**   
1.	1  - The software system prompts the User (i.e., the administrator) to select a MBLH member from a list of MBLH members. If the selected MBLH member has already reached their limit on motorboat hires for the week, then the system informs the User (by displaying an appropriate message) and takes no further action (i.e., the system returns to the main menu).  
2.	2  - The User is then prompted to enter a day and time to propose a motorboat hire.   
3a - If the MBLH member is already involved with a lesson or hire at the day/time of the proposed motorboat hire, then the system informs the User (by displaying an appropriate message) and takes no further action (i.e., the system returns to the main menu).   
3b - Otherwise, the system checks whether any of the club motorboats are available at the selected time/day (i.e., they are not already booked for either a lesson or a hire at the selected time/day).   
3b(i) - If there are no available club motorboats available at that time/day, the system informs the user (by displaying an appropriate message) and takes no further action (i.e., the system returns to the main menu)   
3b(ii) - If any of the club motorboats are available, then the names of the available motorboats are displayed to the console and the User is prompted to select which motorboat should be used and, on selection, the hire is recorded (for the runtime of the program). A confirmation message is displayed with the details of the hire.   
Use case #5: Display motorboat bookings   
1 - The system allows the User (i.e., the administrator) to select a motorboat from a list of all motorboat names owned by the club.   
2 – On selection of a motorboat name, the system displays a weekly schedule (i.e., all days and times) of bookings for the selected motorboat, indicating if the motorboat is booked for a lesson, booked for hire, or still available for each day/time slot across the week.
